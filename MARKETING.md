# LIMITED - Marketing & Launch Plan

## Core Concept
**One truth. One chance. Forever.**

LIMITED is a confession app where users get exactly ONE opportunity per category to write something permanent. No edits, no deletes, no second chances.

## App Store Listing

### App Name
`LIMITED - One Truth Forever`

### Subtitle (30 chars)
`Seal your truth. No second chances.`

### Keywords
`confession, journal, truth, secret, anonymous, one chance, permanent, seal, locked, forever, mental health, release, let go`

### Description

```
Some things can only be said once.

LIMITED gives you one chance—just one—to write something that matters. A confession. A goodbye. A truth you've carried too long.

Once you seal it, it's permanent. No edits. No deletes. No going back.

WHY LIMITED?

We all carry weight. Words unspoken. Feelings buried. Truths we've hidden so deep we forgot they're there.

LIMITED is not about validation or likes. It's about release. The act of finally saying what you've held inside.

HOW IT WORKS

• Choose a category: Confess, Forgive, Goodbye, Love, Regret, Fear, Gratitude, Dream, Secret, or your Final Truth
• Write your one truth
• Seal it forever
• Join thousands who've had the courage to speak

THE GLOBAL WALL

See anonymous truths from people around the world. You're not alone in what you carry.

FEATURES

✦ 10 emotional categories
✦ One chance per category—choose wisely
✦ Real global counter of sealed truths
✦ Anonymous global wall
✦ Beautiful, focused interface
✦ No accounts, no social pressure
✦ Your truths stay on your device

This isn't an app you use every day. It's a ritual. A moment of courage. A permanent mark that you were here, and you had something to say.

Some truths deserve to exist. Even if no one ever reads them.

Download LIMITED. Say what you've never said. Seal it forever.
```

### Reddit Post (r/apps, r/minimalism, r/mentalhealth)
```
Title: I built an app where you only get ONE chance to write something

I wanted to create something different. Not another notes app or journal that you'll abandon.

LIMITED gives you exactly one opportunity per category to write something permanent. A confession. A goodbye. Words you've never said.

Once you seal it, it's done. No edits. No deletes.

The idea is that constraints create meaning. When you only get one shot, you think carefully about what you really want to say.

There's also a global wall where you can see anonymous truths from others. It's surprisingly powerful to realize you're not alone in what you carry.

It's free, no accounts, and your truths stay on your device.

Would love feedback from this community.
